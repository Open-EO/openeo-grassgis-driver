===========================
The OpenEO GRASS GIS driver
===========================

The OpenEO GRASS GIS driver implements the openEO Core API interface for the GRASS GIS as a Service
(actinia-core; available from https://github.com/mundialis/actinia_core; DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5879231) software solution for parallel,
large scale geodata processing.

It is a highly scalable REST interface to process geodata with the GRASS GIS in a distributed environment.
GRASS GIS is a free and open source software package providing geospatial processing engines in a single
integrated environment for raster, vector, and 3D-voxel processing as well as image processing capabilities.

It is deployed on **openeo.mundialis.de** and will be used for processing all openEO API calls that are send
to the `OpenEO GRASS GIS driver <https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-grassgis-driver/>`_.
